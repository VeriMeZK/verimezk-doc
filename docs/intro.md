# Welcome to the VeriMeZK Documentation

**VeriMeZK** is a lightweight, open-source toolkit for privacy-preserving identity verification. It lets users prove attributes, such as age or nationality, without disclosing the underlying data. Everything runs locally, with optional verification on the **Midnight** blockchain.

## What Is VeriMeZK?

VeriMeZK enables developers to embed zero-knowledge identity checks into their applications. The toolkit combines:

- Document scanning for passports and ID cards
- Face verification with built-in liveness detection
- Local generation of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)
- Optional on-chain verification powered by Midnight

## Key Capabilities

- **Zero-knowledge proofs** validate facts without exposing personal data.
- **Client-side processing** keeps sensitive information on the user's device.
- **Blockchain integration** provides on-chain verification when required.
- **Custom checks** allow teams to define business-specific rules (for example, "is over 18" or "is an EU resident").

## Who Should Use VeriMeZK?

- Teams building privacy-first applications
- dApp creators who need KYC assurances without storing identity data
- Anyone evaluating decentralized identity and ZKP-native workflows
